# Getting Started

Vue DNDNR is a Vue 3 component library that provides powerful, flexible, and type-safe draggable and resizable functionality for your applications.

## What is Vue DNDNR?

Vue DNDNR offers both component-based and composable hook-based approaches to implement drag and resize features in your Vue 3 applications. The library is built with TypeScript and follows modern Vue 3 composition API patterns, making it highly flexible and easy to integrate.

## Core Features

- **Dual API Approach**: Use either pre-built components or composable hooks based on your needs
- **Draggable Elements**: Create elements that can be moved with mouse or touch input
- **Resizable Elements**: Add resize handles to elements with customizable constraints
- **Combined DnR Functionality**: Seamlessly combine drag and resize capabilities
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type safety with comprehensive TypeScript definitions
- **Vue 3 Composition API**: Built using the latest Vue 3 patterns and best practices
- **Customizable Constraints**: Set boundaries, grid snapping, and size limits
- **Event Handling**: Rich event system for responding to user interactions
- **Touch Support**: Works on both desktop and touch devices
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation support and ARIA attributes

## Components and Hooks

Vue DNDNR provides three main components:

- **`<Draggable>`**: For creating draggable elements
- **`<Resizable>`**: For creating resizable elements
- **`<DnR>`**: For elements that need both drag and resize functionality

Each component has a corresponding composable hook:

- **`useDraggable()`**: Hook for adding drag functionality
- **`useResizable()`**: Hook for adding resize functionality
- **`useDnR()`**: Hook combining both drag and resize capabilities
